We enable organizations of all sizes to easily build, scale, and run modern applications by helping them modernize legacy workloads, embrace innovation, and unleash AI. Our industry-leading developer data platform, MongoDB Atlas, is the only globally distributed, multi-cloud database and is available in more than 115 regions across AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. Atlas allows customers to build and run applications anywhere—on premises, or across cloud providers. With offices worldwide and over 175,000 new developers signing up to use MongoDB every month, it's no wonder that leading organizations, like Samsung and Toyota, trust MongoDB to build next-generation, AI-powered applications.

The worldwide data management software market is massive (IDC forecasts it to be $138 billion by 2026!). At MongoDB we are transforming industries and empowering developers to build amazing apps that people use every day. We are the leading modern data platform and the first database provider to IPO in over 20 years. Join our team and be at the forefront of innovation and creativity.

Building on the rapid success and adoption of MongoDB, we are delivering applications and services that make it much easier to manage and scale database deployments. These next-generation systems are a growing list but currently include products such as Atlas (www.cloud.mongodb.com), Cloud Manager and Compass.

MongoDB Technical Services Engineers use their outstanding problem solving and customer service skills, along with their deep technical experience, to advise customers and to solve their complex MongoDB problems. Technical Service Engineers are specialists in the entire MongoDB ecosystem - database server, drivers, our management suite, and services such as Cloud Manager (the online product we developed for customers for automation, backup, monitoring, and analysis of their MongoDB systems). Our engineers combine their MongoDB expertise with passion, initiative, teamwork, and a great sense of humor to achieve exceptional results for our customers.

We are looking to speak to candidates who are based in Sydney for our hybrid working model. The standard work week post ramping will be Sunday to Thursday, every week.

### **Why MongoDB is a fantastic place to work and build your career**

* Be a part of the company that's reinventing the database, passionate about innovation and speed
* Enjoy a fun, inspiring culture that is engineering focused
* Work with exceptionally talented people around the globe
* Learn, contribute, and make an impact on the product and community

### **Cool things you'll do**

MongoDB is on a mission to change the way people think about databases. Along the way, our customers encounter questions and issues about how our approach to databases works for their use case. In Technical Services, it's our job to help these people.

You'll be working alongside our largest customers, solving their complex issues - resolving questions on architecture, performance, recovery, security, and everything in between. You'll be an expert resource on standard methodologies in running MongoDB at scale, whatever that scale may be. You'll be an advocate for customers' needs - working with our product management and development teams on their behalf. And you'll contribute to internal projects, including software development of support tools for performance, benchmarking, and diagnostics.

MongoDB Technical Services puts a strong focus on engineers enabling their peers to be successful by sharing newly gained technical knowledge with the team, either via informal one-to-one conversations, or training and workshop sessions. By documenting solutions in our knowledge platform, TSEs will increase the efficiency of our customers, other team members and departments throughout MongoDB.

### **What you need**

You should have 4+ years of proven experience, we consider all candidates with an eye for those who are self-taught, insatiably curious, and multi-faceted.

### **The ideal candidate should have a mix of experience in most of the following areas:**

* Strong diagnostics and troubleshooting experience, with the ability to analyze issues holistically, from the application tier, to database to storage
* Broad awareness of customer workloads and use cases, including performance, availability, and scalability
* Systems engineering experience, including Linux performance, memory management, I/O tuning, configuration, security, networking, clusters, and troubleshooting
* Ability to read code, and basic coding/scripting ability in one or more languages: Java, Python, Ruby, C, C++, C#, Javascript, node.js, Go, etc
* Good understanding of Networking concepts and protocols (DNS, TCP/IP, SSL/TLS, etc.)
* Storage engineering experience, including NAS, RAID, SAN, SSD, multi-pathing, and caching
* Experience supporting complex mission-critical product applications and database systems (RDMBS or non-relational)

You should possess a genuine desire to help people, the ability to think on your feet and remain calm under pressure while solving problems in real-time. There's a lot to learn, so the desire and ability to rapidly learn a wide variety of new technical skills is paramount. We work in a collaborative team environment, so a willingness and ability to get help from team members when required, and good judgment to know when to seek help, is essential. We also aim to have diverse technical backgrounds and therefore different subject matter expertise is welcome.

You do not need to have prior experience with MongoDB. We can teach you that!

### **Bonus Points**

* Experience with authentication systems such as LDAP, Kerberos, AD
* Experience using or managing MongoDB
* Experience using distributed version control systems, and in particular git
* Experience using any cloud services stack such as AWS, Azure or GCP
* Experience with Kubernetes or other orchestration systems using vendor-specific Enterprise operators

* In 6 months, you will be comfortable working frontline with our customers. You will also complete the MongoDB Certified DBA Associate exam
* In 12 months, you will be a part of a technical experts group within MongoDB and will be helping your peer engineers in advance diagnostics. Also, you will be encouraged to handle technical escalations independently

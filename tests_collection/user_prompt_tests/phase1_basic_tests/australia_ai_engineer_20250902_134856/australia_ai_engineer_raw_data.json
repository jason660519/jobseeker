    "description":"MongoDB's mission is to empower innovators to create, transform, and disrupt industries by unleashing the power of software and data. We enable organizations of all sizes to easily build, scale, and run modern applications by helping them modernize legacy workloads, embrace innovation, and unleash AI. Our industry-leading developer data platform, MongoDB Atlas, is the only globally distributed, multi-cloud database and is available in more than 115 regions across AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. Atlas allows customers to build and run applications anywhere—on premises, or across cloud providers. With offices worldwide and over 175,000 new developers signing up to use MongoDB every month, it's no wonder that leading organizations, like Samsung and Toyota, trust MongoDB to build next-generation, AI-powered applications.\n\nThe worldwide data management software market is massive (IDC forecasts it to be $138 billion by 2026!). At MongoDB we are transforming industries and empowering developers to build amazing apps that people use every day. We are the leading modern data platform and the first database provider to IPO in over 20 years. Join our team and be at the forefront of innovation and creativity.\n\nBuilding on the rapid success and adoption of MongoDB, we are delivering applications and services that make it much easier to manage and scale database deployments. These next-generation systems are a growing list but currently include products such as Atlas (www.cloud.mongodb.com), Cloud Manager and Compass.\n\nMongoDB Technical Services Engineers use their outstanding problem solving and customer service skills, along with their deep technical experience, to advise customers and to solve their complex MongoDB problems. Technical Service Engineers are specialists in the entire MongoDB ecosystem - database server, drivers, our management suite, and services such as Cloud Manager (the online product we developed for customers for automation, backup, monitoring, and analysis of their MongoDB systems). Our engineers combine their MongoDB expertise with passion, initiative, teamwork, and a great sense of humor to achieve exceptional results for our customers.\n\nWe are looking to speak to candidates who are based in Sydney for our hybrid working model. The standard work week post ramping will be Sunday to Thursday, every week.\n\n### **Why MongoDB is a fantastic place to work and build your career**\n\n* Be a part of the company that's reinventing the database, passionate about innovation and speed\n* Enjoy a fun, inspiring culture that is engineering focused\n* Work with exceptionally talented people around the globe\n* Learn, contribute, and make an impact on the product and community\n\n### **Cool things you'll do**\n\nMongoDB is on a mission to change the way people think about databases. Along the way, our customers encounter questions and issues about how our approach to databases works for their use case. In Technical Services, it's our job to help these people.\n\nYou'll be working alongside our largest customers, solving their complex issues - resolving questions on architecture, performance, recovery, security, and everything in between. You'll be an expert resource on standard methodologies in running MongoDB at scale, whatever that scale may be.

    "description":"### **We are see****king a Staff Engineer to join our Melbourne team.**\n\n### **The Opportunity: Where Technical Excellence Meets Life-****Changing Impact**\n\nImagine leading a team that builds technology used by millions of people across 19 countries, processing over $90M in donations annually - all in service of changing the face of men's health. This isn't just another tech lead role; it's a chance to shape how Movember transforms from a campaign powerhouse into a year-round force for good in men's health.\n\nYou'll be joining us at an inflection point. We're modernising from a battle-tested monolith to a composable, domain-driven architecture using AWS Lambda and Node.js. We're pioneering AI-augmented development with tools like Claude Code and Windsurf. And we’re doing it all to create a world-class fundraising & community platform.\n\n### **Why This Role Matters**\n\nEvery line of code you and your team write, every architectural decision you support, and every developer you mentor directly impacts our ability to fund life-saving health programs. When your team optimises our payment processing by milliseconds,more donations flow to suicide prevention. When your team builds resilient systems, researchers get reliable data for prostate cancer breakthroughs.\n\nThis is engineering with purpose.\n\n### **What Makes This Role Unique**\n\n**You're Not Just a Tech Lead** - You're a force multiplier who empowers developers to deliver their best work. You'll balance deep technical expertise with genuine people mentorship, turning good developers into great ones through pair programming, thoughtful code reviews, and creating psychological safety for innovation.\n\n**Campaign Season is Your Team's AFL Grand Final** - Every October through December, our platform experiences massive scale challenges that matches the traffic of large global organisations. Think Black Friday meets social movement. While we've solved the basics, there’re endless opportunities for optimisation and innovation. You'll lead your team through these high-stakes periods with grace, ensuring our global community can fundraise without friction.\n\n**AI is Your Co****-Pilot,** **Not Your Replacement** - We're at the beginning of an exciting AI transformation journey. You'll help shape how we integrate AI into our development processes, from advanced context engineering to MCP servers, making our small team punch well above our weight.\n\n**You Think in Horizons,** **Not Sprints** - While your team delivers value quarterly, you're always thinking 6-12 months ahead. You understand that today's quick fix is tomorrow's technical debt, and you make decisions that balance immediate needs with long-term sustainability.\n\n**Every Day is Different** - One moment you're pair programming with a junior developer, turning bug fixes into teaching moments about distributed systems. The next, you're collaborating with Product and Marketing to translate their vision for personalised donor experiences into technical reality. You'll help architect solutions for payment processing that handle 100x traffic spikes across 19 regulatory environments, then shift to one-on-ones where you help team members navigate the journey from monolithic to business services thinking. In our hybrid work environment, office days buzz with collaborative energy while remote days offer deep focus time.\n\n### **The Technical Playground**\n\n**Core Stack**: Node.js, React, JavaScript, TypeScript, AWS services including Lambda, PHP\n\n**External Integration**: Platform integrated with a wide variety of services from Healthcare API’s to Payment providers\n\n**Architecture Journey**: Actively migrating from monolith to business services, giving you the rare opportunity to help shape architecture\n\n**Scale Challenges**: Handle everything from steady-state operations to 100x traffic spikes\n\n**AI Integration**: Implement AI-powered personalisation, chat bots, process and development automation\n\n**Glo****bal Reach**: Build systems that work across 19 countries with different languages, currencies, and regulations\n\n### **For this role you'll need:**\n\n* 8+ years software development experience with 3+ years in senior\/lead roles\n* 5+ years' experience developing across the full stack including NodeJS \/ React \/ JavaScript \/ TypeScript\n\n* Proven experience with high-traffic web platforms and large-scale, high-availability systemsStrong background in AWS cloud platform and infrastructure as code (CloudFormation or serverless architecture)\n* Experience with microservices architecture and distributed systems using AWS Lambda\n* Deep understanding of monitoring, observability, and incident response for production systems\n* Strong understanding of automated pipelines, CI\/CD, AWS CodePipeline\n* Knowledge of payment processing systems and PCI DSS compliance\n* Experience with DevOps practices and tooling\n* Strong understanding of CSS \/ frameworks like bootstrap \/ SASS \/ LESS\n* HTTP and REST or GraphQL\n* Strong understanding of testing frameworks\n* Experience working with agile development processes\n* Excellent communication skills and ability to translate business needs into technical language\n* Track record of leading teams through critical incidents and high-pressure situations\n\n### **Desirable:**\n\n* Advanced prompt engineering for code generation, RAG system design & AI system architecture\n* Experience with AI\/ML implementation and architectural principles\n* Experience with AI-powered personalisation and content generation\n* Experience with headless CMS\n* Knowledge of front end framework alternatives to React (eg Angular, Vue)\n* Experience establishing and maintaining UI component libraries\n* Knowledge of CDN strategies for global reach\n* Experience with security architecture and threat modelling\n* Knowledge of zero-trust security principles\n* Health care domain experience (bonus points if you've saved lives with code before)\n* Experience working in newly established teams helping to build shared outcomes\n* Exposure to Quantum-resistant cryptography\n* Experience with technical ROI assessment\n* Experience working with off-shore development teams\n\n**GOOD CAUSE:**  \nWorking for **Movember**, you’ll help raise millions for men’s health (not for a CEO’s bonus). And all those dollars do a whole lotta good. We’ve funded cancer research. Created lifesaving medicines. And helped make cancer treatments less “one-size-fits-all”, and more specific to each patient’s needs.\n\nWe’re even calling for governments worldwide to get it together on men’s health. By meeting directly with policymakers so they change the systems that change men’s health.\n\n**GOOD VIBES:**  \nThe vibes aren’t just for Fridays – even though we start weekends early nine months of the year. Here, it always feels like something big’s about to happen. Be it an office-wide surprise birthday party (with cake!) or an impromptu all-staff boogie.\n\nCome the hairy season, the energy gets silly. We’re talking celebrity visits. Live stunts on-site for TV and radio. And when we hit a fundraising milestone, the office gong might even go off. And that means one thing: it’s conga time.\n\n**GOOD CREW:**  \nLet’s just get this out of the way: big egos need not apply. We’re all about straight-up solid human beings out to do meaningful work. People who’ll help you reach career-best moments. And give you the freedom to get there the best way you see fit.\n\nHybrid remote working is the norm. And in the office, you can sit where you please. Who knows? On any given day you could even end up desk buddies with the man who started this all.\n\n* Flexible hybrid working from home and our modern Richmond office\n* Finish work at 2pm on Fridays (Dec-Aug)\n* NFP salary packaging (pay less tax)\n* 13 weeks paid parental leave and 5 weeks annual leave\n* Fun & collaborative culture with employee social events\n* Free Headspace subscription and other wellbeing initiative\n* Relaxed dress code\n\n**Boy, do we know the feeling of being judged.** (Over how we look, and other things that shouldn’t matter.) Being different is how we started. And it’s also helped us raise $1 billion for men’s health. So, we know the power of diverse experiences, skills and perspectives.\n\nAnd another impressive number is our WGEA gender pay gap: it sits at a big, fat, round 0%. If you’ve got the relevant skills and the right attitude, let nothing stand in your way of firing off your application.\n\n**Do you want to DO GOOD?**  \nIf so, we’d love to hear from you.",

    "description":"### **We are see****king a Staff Engineer to join our Melbourne team.**\n\n### **The Opportunity: Where Technical Excellence Meets Life-****Changing Impact**\n\nImagine leading a team that builds technology used by millions of people across 19 countries, processing over $90M in donations annually - all in service of changing the face of men's health. This isn't just another tech lead role; it's a chance to shape how Movember transforms from a campaign powerhouse into a year-round force for good in men's health.\n\nYou'll be joining us at an inflection point. We're modernising from a battle-tested monolith to a composable, domain-driven architecture using AWS Lambda and Node.js. We're pioneering AI-augmented development with tools like Claude Code and Windsurf. And we’re doing it all to create a world-class fundraising & community platform.\n\n### **Why This Role Matters**\n\nEvery line of code you and your team write, every architectural decision you support, and every developer you mentor directly impacts our ability to fund life-saving health programs. When your team optimises our payment processing by milliseconds,more donations flow to suicide prevention. When your team builds resilient systems, researchers get reliable data for prostate cancer breakthroughs.\n\nThis is engineering with purpose.\n\n### **What Makes This Role Unique**\n\n**You're Not Just a Tech Lead** - You're a force multiplier who empowers developers to deliver their best work. You'll balance deep technical expertise with genuine people mentorship, turning good developers into great ones through pair programming, thoughtful code reviews, and creating psychological safety for innovation.\n\n**Campaign Season is Your Team's AFL Grand Final** - Every October through December, our platform experiences massive scale challenges that matches the traffic of large global organisations. Think Black Friday meets social movement. While we've solved the basics, there’re endless opportunities for optimisation and innovation. You'll lead your team through these high-stakes periods with grace, ensuring our global community can fundraise without friction.\n\n**AI is Your Co****-Pilot,** **Not Your Replacement** - We're at the beginning of an exciting AI transformation journey. You'll help shape how we integrate AI into our development processes, from advanced context engineering to MCP servers, making our small team punch well above our weight.\n\n**You Think in Horizons,** **Not Sprints** - While your team delivers value quarterly, you're always thinking 6-12 months ahead. You understand that today's quick fix is tomorrow's technical debt, and you make decisions that balance immediate needs with long-term sustainability.\n\n**Every Day is Different** - One moment you're pair programming with a junior developer, turning bug fixes into teaching moments about distributed systems. The next, you're collaborating with Product and Marketing to translate their vision for personalised donor experiences into technical reality.

And all those dollars do a whole lotta good. We’ve funded cancer research. Created lifesaving medicines. And helped make cancer treatments less “one-size-fits-all”, and more specific to each patient’s needs.\n\nWe’re even calling for governments worldwide to get it together on men’s health. By meeting directly with policymakers so they change the systems that change men’s health.\n\n**GOOD VIBES:**  \nThe vibes aren’t just for Fridays – even though we start weekends early nine months of the year. Here, it always feels like something big’s about to happen. Be it an office-wide surprise birthday party (with cake!) or an impromptu all-staff boogie.\n\nCome the hairy season, the energy gets silly. We’re talking celebrity visits. Live stunts on-site for TV and radio. And when we hit a fundraising milestone, the office gong might even go off. And that means one thing: it’s conga time.\n\n**GOOD CREW:**  \nLet’s just get this out of the way: big egos need not apply. We’re all about straight-up solid human beings out to do meaningful work. People who’ll help you reach career-best moments. And give you the freedom to get there the best way you see fit.\n\nHybrid remote working is the norm. And in the office, you can sit where you please. Who knows? On any given day you could even end up desk buddies with the man who started this all.\n\n* Flexible hybrid working from home and our modern Richmond office\n* Finish work at 2pm on Fridays (Dec-Aug)\n* NFP salary packaging (pay less tax)\n* 13 weeks paid parental leave and 5 weeks annual leave\n* Fun & collaborative culture with employee social events\n* Free Headspace subscription and other wellbeing initiative\n* Relaxed dress code\n\n**Boy, do we know the feeling of being judged.** (Over how we look, and other things that shouldn’t matter.) Being different is how we started. And it’s also helped us raise $1 billion for men’s health. So, we know the power of diverse experiences, skills and perspectives.\n\nAnd another impressive number is our WGEA gender pay gap: it sits at a big, fat, round 0%. If you’ve got the relevant skills and the right attitude, let nothing stand in your way of firing off your application.\n\n**Do you want to DO GOOD?**  \nIf so, we’d love to hear from you.\n\n  \n\nTeam\n\nIT - TechMo's\n\nLocations\n\nMelbourne\n\nRemote status\n\nHybrid\n\nEmployment Status\n\nFull-Time\n\n  \n\n**About Movember**\n------------------\n\n**Movember** is the global leader in men’s health. Our focus is on mental health, suicide prevention, prostate cancer and testicular cancer. Since beginning over drinks at a bar in 2003 in Melbourne, we’ve expanded internationally, raised over $1 billion for men’s health and funded more than 1,320 men’s health related projects globally.\n\nFounded in 2003\n\nCo-workers 350+ Globally",

Our flagship agent, Obi, is already live with fast-growing SaaS companies, transforming how they onboard and educate customers.\n\nWe’re early, funded, and moving fast. The next decade belongs to teams building at the edge of AI. That’s where we live.\n\n#### **Why You Should Care**\n\n* **Work on problems few teams in the world are touching** – advanced voice AI, LLM optimisation, real-time performance.\n* **Build with founders, not layers** – direct access, full ownership, no corporate drag.\n* **Be in the room** – our Collingwood space is packed with ambitious startups, investors, and builders.\n* **Shape the future** – AI professional services will reshape software, and you’ll be one of the people making it happen.\n\n#### **What You’ll Do**\n\n* Architect, build, and optimise voice AI systems.\n* Test and refine LLMs, pipelines, and integrations.\n* Own features end-to-end – from sketch to production.\n* Work directly with customers to turn feedback into product.\n* Collaborate daily with the founding team on product and culture.\n\n#### **What We’re Looking For**\n\n* Strong experience in **Python or Go**.\n* Bonus points for **TypeScript\/React**.\n* A track record in startups or scrappy teams.\n* Comfort using AI tools to make your work faster and sharper.\n* Hunger to learn, bias for shipping, and the ability to flex your opinions to fit the team and environment.\n* Adaptability: you know how to navigate ambiguity and thrive in fast-changing conditions.\n\n*(Note: We’re not training models. We’re focused on applied AI - building real products on top of LLMs.)*\n\n#### **What You’ll Get**\n\n* **Meaningful equity (0.25–0.5%)**: not a token gesture, but real ownership at an early stage where growth has outsized upside. The next round could multiply today’s value in ways late-stage options never can.\n* A competitive startup salary, balanced with ownership.\n* Real responsibility and influence from day one - whether mid-level or senior.\n* A hybrid setup in a vibrant startup hub.\n* The chance to look back in 5 years and say, *“I was there when this started.”*\n\n**Don’t just join a company.

The assets that produce, store, and consume electrons will define the next era of the economy. But today, financing these assets is slow, expensive, and fragmented, locked behind legacy intermediaries and limited access.

Plural is passionately building the infrastructure to change that. We tokenize everything from solar projects to batteries to bitcoin mines, using smart contracts and programmable workflows to reduce friction and open access to capital.

On Plural, the nodes of a distributed grid are financed by a network of institutional, individual, and DeFi investors. This approach lowers costs, increases transparency, and enables scalable capital formation for the energy transition—trusted, composable, and built for efficiency.

* Leveraging modern AI primitives (LLMs, embeddings, vector DBs, retrieval, evals, agentic workflows) to build systems with real business impact.
* Staying current on fast-moving AI research and trends—ensuring Plural is always on the frontier.
* Receiving tight feedback loops and mentorship from the CTO.

**Qualifications:**
-------------------

### **Required:**

* 3+ years of experience architecting, building, deploying, and maintaining web-apps in a production cloud-native environment

* Power user of AI development tools like Cursor
* Hungry, driven self-starter with a demonstrated track record of high agency and attention to detail

### **Bonus:**

* Experience building in Google Cloud
* Experience at an exchange or leading DeFi protocol

---------------

The Customer Engagement Technology (CET) team leads AI/LLM- (Large Language Model) driven customer experience transformation using task-oriented dialog systems. We develop multi-modal, multi-turn, goal-oriented dialog systems that can handle customer issues at Amazon scale across multiple languages. These systems are designed to adapt to changing company policies and invoke correct APIs to automate solutions to customer problems. Additionally, we enhance associate productivity through response/action recommendation, summarization to capture conversation context succinctly, retrieving precise information from documents to provide useful information to the agent, and machine translation to facilitate smoother conversations when the customer and agent speak different languages.  
  
Key focus areas include:  
  

* Task-Oriented Dialog Systems: Building reliable, scalable, and adaptive LLM-based agents for understanding intents, determining eligibilities, making API calls, confirming outcomes, and exploring alternatives across hundreds of customer service intents, while adapting to changing policies.
* Lifelong Learning: Researching continuous learning approaches for injecting new domain knowledge while retaining the model's foundational abilities and preventing catastrophic forgetting.
* Agentic Systems: Developing a modular agentic framework to handle multi-domain conversations through appropriate system abstractions.
* Complex Multi-turn Instruction Following: Identifying approaches to guarantee compliance with instructions that specify standard operating procedures for handling multi-turn complex scenarios.
* Inference-Time Adaptability: Researching inference-time scaling methods and improving in-context learning abilities of custom models to enable real-time adaptability to new features, actions, or bug fixes without solely relying on retraining.

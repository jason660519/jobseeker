    "description":"**About Aios Medical**\n======================\n\nOur overarching mission is to accelerate the mass-market adoption of consumer biotech products so every human can live at least 100 healthy years. Our immediate focus is excess bodyweight. We are increasing the accessibility of GLP-1 medications to accelerate their take-up to help solve obesity worldwide.\n\nTo do that, we’re building an AI-powered clinical operating system: ClinicOS. ClinicOS makes it effortless for consumer brands to easily offer direct-to-patient healthcare, globally. We work with external Brand Partners, as well as using this infrastructure to scale our own internal consumer healthcare brands.\n\nSince we launched Fella Health in the US in June 2021, Fella has positioned itself as no-nonsense weight loss for busy bigger guys. Today, we operate multiple brands across the US & UK — our two biggest are Fella Health (US & UK) & Bolt Pharmacy (UK).\n\nOur infrastructure will have served 100 million patients worldwide by 2035. We’ll then use that direct-to-patient infrastructure to serve next-gen biotech products at-scale to increase the proportion of humans living at least 100 healthy years.\n\nIn so doing, we’ll become the world’s first trillion dollar healthcare company.\n\n### **How far along are we?**\n\n**We’ve grown >2000x since Aug 2021, >200x since Aug 2022, >20x since Aug 2023**. We’re >$50M\/yr revenue. We’ve been cashflow positive since June 2023. We’re >10,000 customers with high NPS.\n\nWe’re a young startup and we’re just getting started. This is still Day 1 and all our work is ahead of us.\n\nWe're backed by top healthcare & consumer investors:\n\n* Y Combinator\n* Global Founders Capital — backed Facebook, Slack, LinkedIn, Revolut, Rocket Internet\n* AngelList Early Stage Fund (backed by Naval Ravikant)\n* BrandProject (venture-builder behind 2 unicorns)\n* The founders of Indeed, Curative (unicorn), Alan (unicorn), Kaia Health (>$300mil valuation), Vouch Insurance (>$500mil valuation), Not Boring (Packy McCormick)\n\nYou can read more about working with us here: Working at Aios Medical https:\/\/fella.notion.site\/working-at-aios-medical\n\n**Being an AI Engineer at Aios Medical**\n----------------------------------------\n\nAs AI Engineering Lead at Aios Medical, you'll architect our AI-first future. You'll own the entire AI strategy across our ClinicOS platform, transforming how millions access healthcare through intelligent automation.\n\nYou'll work directly with me, Gzim (our Head of Engineering), our CEO (Richie Cartwright) and the rest of the AI engineering team to build AI systems that deliver world-class healthcare at software scale.\n\nThis role combines deep technical expertise with strategic vision. You'll ship production AI while defining our long-term roadmap. You'll automate clinical workflows, build AI assistants that enhance our providers, and create systems that scale to 100 million patients.\n\nIf you're excited by making healthcare radically more accessible through AI, can build LLM reliable LLM powered apps, and want your work to directly impact people - this role is for you.\n\nThis is a full-time, fully remote role. You must thrive in intense, high-velocity environments. This will be the most impactful work of your career.\n\n**Key Responsibilities**\n------------------------\n\nYou'll build and lead our AI systems across the entire company. We need someone who can ship production AI while keeping it simple, reliable, and actually useful. You'll work across clinical, growth, and operations - wherever AI can make us 10x better\n\n* Core AI infrastructure: Build a model-agnostic AI platform that lets us switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, and open-source models seamlessly. Set up robust A\/B testing to optimize performance and costs. Create intelligent routing that matches tasks to the right models. Implement comprehensive monitoring and ensure high reliability with proper fallbacks.\n* AI-powered clinical care: Drive AI adoption across our clinical operating system. Find the manual processes that slow us down and automate them intelligently. Create AI assistants that make our clinical team more effective. Measure impact rigorously - every feature must demonstrably improve patient outcomes and operational efficiency.\n* AI-powered growth: Leverage AI to transform our conversion funnel from personalized outreach sequences to AI sales agents that close deals. Source new tools like AI video generation, voice synthesis, and behavioral prediction models and adapt them to our specific needs & infrastructure. Target human-level conversion rates while removing all manual touch-points.\n* Data & experimentation: Be genuinely obsessed with data - it should be your default way of thinking. Study our datasets to identify AI opportunities, build lightweight MVPs in days not months, and run controlled tests with clear KPIs. Create feedback loops that tell us within weeks if something works. Scale winners, kill losers, and always let data drive decisions over intuition.\n\n**Need to Have**\n----------------\n\n* Have 6+ years of highly relevant experience in software engineering with a focus on AI and machine learning\n* Have strong experience building production applications powered by LLMs. Prompt and context engineering, RAG systems, model fine-tuning and evaluation frameworks.\n* Possess strong programming skills using **Typescript** and\/or Python\n* Have strong experience designing and building modern, customer-facing API’s\n* Are comfortable building user-friendly interfaces using React or similar frameworks\n* Have experience leading engineering team members\n\n**Nice to Have**\n----------------\n\n* Experience with AI\/ML infrastructure including vector databases, embedding models, and orchestration frameworks\n* Have built evaluation and monitoring systems for LLM applications in production\n* Have experience building large-scale data pipelines and distributed systems\n* Have experience with cloud platforms (AWS) at enterprise scale\n* Have a CS degree or equivalent experience\n* Have open source contributions\n\n**Our cultural standards**\n--------------------------\n\nThese are the core cultural standards to which we hold ourselves & our team-members at Fella:\n\nThese are the core cultural standards to which we hold ourselves & our team-members:\n\n* Belief in the mission: We will have served 100 million patients by the end of 2035 and we transform the life of most patients who join. We have a lot of work to do. We are obsessed with our patients and are dedicated to the mission.\n* Unwavering integrity: We are at the frontier, so we often live in ambiguity with no trodden path. When we can’t look to others for guidance, we must maintain impeccable ethics and unwavering integrity.\n* Only the paranoid survive: Bad sh\\*t is coming. By joining us, you’re choosing to sail straight towards the storms with unhesitating conviction. However much we’ve already done, however far we’ve already come — it’s still Day 1 and all our work is ahead of us.\n* If we’re average we fail: We are only interested in “insanely great”, a focus on the quality of our execution that in everyday life would be considered pathological. We have a dedication to excellence and reject incompetence.\n* Commitment to candor: That which can be destroyed by the truth should be. You get full transparency from the company and the company expects full transparency from you. We never say anything about someone that we wouldn’t say to them directly. We give feedback with love and do not need to protect people from fleeting physical sensations.\n* A maniacal sense of urgency: We execute at an intensity that most people think is impossible. Speed is critical and we need things done yesterday. We all work very hard and in such a competitive world there really is no other way to win.\n* Enduring frugality: We are frugal. We hate being wasteful and we are anti-luxury. A culture of cheapness keeps us young. We spend our cash wisely & carefully — in a way that would make our grandmas proud.\n* Bulldozing barriers: The world is malleable and we shape it. We truly believe this and act accordingly. We are relentlessly resourceful and are at the mercy of no-one but ourselves. You’ll be shocked how capable you are and how much you can achieve.\n* Keep your head down: We’re boring people doing exciting work. We don’t chase short-term status — we ignore short-term dopamine hits and focus on what matters.

    "description":"Prudential’s purpose is to be partners for every life and protectors for every future. Our purpose encourages everything we do by creating a culture in which diversity is celebrated and inclusion assured, for our people, customers, and partners. We provide a platform for our people to do their best work and make an impact to the business, and we support our people’s career ambitions. We pledge to make Prudential a place where you can Connect, Grow, and Succeed.\n\nThis role is responsible for driving data-driven transformation in Policy Servicing (managing and updating insurance policies) and Customer Servicing (customer support and inquiries) operations. The role integrates advanced analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) into everyday insurance operations to optimize efficiency, enhance customer experience, and enable scalable automation. This manager will leverage tools like Databricks for big data processing, Python and SQL for analysis, and AI technologies (including developing co-pilot style bots and data analytics assistants) to empower teams and streamline policy and customer service workflows. By combining deep insurance domain knowledge with expertise in data analytics and AI enablement, the Senior Manager ensures that the organization’s servicing processes become smarter, faster, and more proactive in meeting customer needs.\n\nJob Descriptions:\n\n*Data & AI Strategy*\n\nDefine and execute a data analytics and AI strategy for policy and customer servicing operations. Develop a transformation roadmap that aligns AI initiatives with business goals to improve service quality and efficiency. This involves identifying high-impact use cases (e.g. automating policy updates, AI-assisted customer inquiries) and rewiring processes to embed analytics and AI solutions end-to-end rather than as bolt-on tools. Ensure the strategy delivers measurable business value in terms of speed, cost, and customer experience improvements\n\n*AI Solution Development & Automation*\n\nLead the development and implementation of AI-driven solutions to automate and enhance policy servicing and customer servicing tasks. This includes building and deploying predictive models and intelligent automation such as chatbots or RPA bots for routine service requests. A core responsibility is to create a custom “co-pilot” AI agent – an intuitive analytics bot – that allows team members (even those without coding skills) to automate their work and retrieve insights easily via natural language. By leveraging technologies like machine learning and natural language processing, the manager enables straight-through processing of service transactions (e.g. automatic policy data updates, smart triage of customer queries) and reduces manual effort and errors.\n\n*Data Analysis & Insights*\n\nBuild-from-scratch advanced analytics to turn operational data into actionable insights for process improvement. Use tools like Databricks for big data processing and SQL\/Python for analysis to identify trends, bottlenecks, and opportunities within servicing workflows. Provide regular reporting and dashboards on key metrics (e.g. turnaround times, volumes, error rates) and conduct deep-dive analyses (such as root-cause analysis of service failures or policy persistency trends). These insights will inform decisions such as where to streamline processes or how to personalize customer engagement, thereby continuously improving operations.\n\n*Team Enablement & Training*\n\nEmpower non-technical team members to leverage data and AI tools in their daily work. This involves designing user-friendly interfaces for the custom AI bot and self-service analytics platforms, and conducting training sessions\/workshops so that operations staff can confidently use these tools to automate tasks and make data-driven decisions. The manager drives a culture shift towards data literacy and innovation, mentoring team members in analytical thinking. By focusing on change management and stakeholder buy-in, ensure that new processes and technologies are adopted smoothly – addressing any resistance through communication and hands-on support. Ultimately, success is seen when frontline servicing teams routinely use AI insights or bots to work smarter, not harder.\n\n*Cross-Functional Collaboration*\n\nCollaborate closely with IT, Data Engineering, and Operations teams to ensure analytics and AI solutions are effectively integrated into the existing tech ecosystem and workflows. Work with IT on data infrastructure (ensuring access to quality data from policy admin systems, CRM, etc.) and with Customer Service managers to align AI enhancements with real-world needs. Partner with underwriting, claims, and product teams to share insights and ensure consistency across the insurance value chain. Additionally, communicate project progress, wins, and learnings to senior leadership, championing the value of AI enablement in operations and securing ongoing support and resources for these initiatives\n\n*Performance Monitoring & Governance*\n\nEstablish governance and continuously monitor outcomes of analytics and AI initiatives. Define clear KPIs (as outlined below) for each project and regularly track performance against baselines to quantify impact (e.g. reduction in processing time or error rate). Ensure robust data governance, security, and regulatory compliance for all solutions – especially when dealing with sensitive customer policy data. This includes working with risk and compliance teams to review AI models for fairness and accuracy, and implementing controls to prevent errors. Use feedback loops to refine models and processes (for example, capture user feedback on the AI co-pilot’s suggestions and improve its algorithms over time). By proactively managing both the technical and change management aspects, ensure sustainable, long-term success of AI enablement programs in operations.\n\nJob Requirements:\n\n* Bachelor’s degree in Analytics, Data Science, Computer Science, Business Administration, or a related field is required. (An advanced degree in data analytics, MBA, or related discipline is advantageous but not mandatory.)\n* A minimum of 8-10 years of experience in data analytics, business intelligence, or operations strategy, with at least 3-5 years in a leadership role managing analytics or process improvement teams. Experience in the insurance or financial services industry, specifically in operations or servicing functions, is required. The ideal candidate has a proven track record of executing analytics projects and implementing AI\/automation solutions in an operational context.\n* Deep familiarity with insurance policy servicing and customer service processes is essential.\n* Professional certifications that demonstrate expertise in insurance operations or analytics are strongly desired. Relevant technical certifications (e.g. Microsoft Certified: Azure Data Engineer, or certifications in data science\/AI) are a plus if they support the technical skillset. (Note: Lean Six Sigma or process improvement certifications, while not mandatory, would further indicate capability in driving operational excellence.)\n\nPrudential is an equal opportunity employer. We provide equality of opportunity of benefits for all who apply and who perform work for our organisation irrespective of sex, race, age, ethnic origin, educational, social and cultural background, marital status, pregnancy and maternity, religion or belief, disability or part-time \/ fixed-term work, or any other status protected by applicable law. We encourage the same standards from our recruitment and third-party suppliers taking into account the context of grade, job and location. We also allow for reasonable adjustments to support people with individual physical or mental health requirements.",

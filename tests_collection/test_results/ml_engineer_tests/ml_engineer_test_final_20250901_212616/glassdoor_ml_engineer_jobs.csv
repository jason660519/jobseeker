We're not just talking about AI - we're building one of the first enterprise-grade LLM implementations that delivers real, measurable value to compliance and legal teams TODAY.

For the last 2 years, we’ve been transforming how organisations handle compliance from a painful checkbox exercise into a smooth, intelligent process. Our AI-powered platform is helping legal, compliance, and marketing teams revolutionise their operations with 80% faster reviews and 4x productivity boosts. (And yes, we triple-checked those numbers!)

**Why is this exciting?**

Because we're surfing the biggest wave in enterprise tech - the AI revolution. As the regtech industry rockets toward a $50 billion future, we're proudly flying the Australian flag on the global stage.

* A background building benchmarking systems
* FastAPI framework knowledge
* Startup or high-growth environment experience
* AWS cloud platform expertise
* Research background in ML or search
* Experience with DevOps and CI/CD tools

**Why Haast**

Growth and Impact:

* Leading the evolution from dull, traditional SaaS to AI-powered workflows (because nobody ever said ""I love manually reviewing disclaimers!"")
* Build enterprise-grade AI technology that major institutions actually trust (and love!)
* Empowering humans to focus on strategic work they love by eliminating tedious compliance reviews
* Creating technology that builds customer trust and protects consumer rights

Benefits and Culture:

* Remote for exceptional candidates, preferably Sydney-based with flexible work arrangements (at least 2 days a week)

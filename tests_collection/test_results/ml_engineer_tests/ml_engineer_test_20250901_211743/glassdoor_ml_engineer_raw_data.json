    "description": "### **We are see****king a Staff Engineer to join our Melbourne team.**\n\n### **The Opportunity: Where Technical Excellence Meets Life-****Changing Impact**\n\nImagine leading a team that builds technology used by millions of people across 19 countries, processing over $90M in donations annually - all in service of changing the face of men's health. This isn't just another tech lead role; it's a chance to shape how Movember transforms from a campaign powerhouse into a year-round force for good in men's health.\n\nYou'll be joining us at an inflection point. We're modernising from a battle-tested monolith to a composable, domain-driven architecture using AWS Lambda and Node.js. We're pioneering AI-augmented development with tools like Claude Code and Windsurf. And we’re doing it all to create a world-class fundraising & community platform.\n\n### **Why This Role Matters**\n\nEvery line of code you and your team write, every architectural decision you support, and every developer you mentor directly impacts our ability to fund life-saving health programs. When your team optimises our payment processing by milliseconds,more donations flow to suicide prevention. When your team builds resilient systems, researchers get reliable data for prostate cancer breakthroughs.\n\nThis is engineering with purpose.\n\n### **What Makes This Role Unique**\n\n**You're Not Just a Tech Lead** - You're a force multiplier who empowers developers to deliver their best work. You'll balance deep technical expertise with genuine people mentorship, turning good developers into great ones through pair programming, thoughtful code reviews, and creating psychological safety for innovation.\n\n**Campaign Season is Your Team's AFL Grand Final** - Every October through December, our platform experiences massive scale challenges that matches the traffic of large global organisations. Think Black Friday meets social movement. While we've solved the basics, there’re endless opportunities for optimisation and innovation. You'll lead your team through these high-stakes periods with grace, ensuring our global community can fundraise without friction.\n\n**AI is Your Co****-Pilot,** **Not Your Replacement** - We're at the beginning of an exciting AI transformation journey. You'll help shape how we integrate AI into our development processes, from advanced context engineering to MCP servers, making our small team punch well above our weight.\n\n**You Think in Horizons,** **Not Sprints** - While your team delivers value quarterly, you're always thinking 6-12 months ahead. You understand that today's quick fix is tomorrow's technical debt, and you make decisions that balance immediate needs with long-term sustainability.\n\n**Every Day is Different** - One moment you're pair programming with a junior developer, turning bug fixes into teaching moments about distributed systems. The next, you're collaborating with Product and Marketing to translate their vision for personalised donor experiences into technical reality. You'll help architect solutions for payment processing that handle 100x traffic spikes across 19 regulatory environments, then shift to one-on-ones where you help team members navigate the journey from monolithic to business services thinking. In our hybrid work environment, office days buzz with collaborative energy while remote days offer deep focus time.\n\n### **The Technical Playground**\n\n**Core Stack**: Node.js, React, JavaScript, TypeScript, AWS services including Lambda, PHP\n\n**External Integration**: Platform integrated with a wide variety of services from Healthcare API’s to Payment providers\n\n**Architecture Journey**: Actively migrating from monolith to business services, giving you the rare opportunity to help shape architecture\n\n**Scale Challenges**: Handle everything from steady-state operations to 100x traffic spikes\n\n**AI Integration**: Implement AI-powered personalisation, chat bots, process and development automation\n\n**Glo****bal Reach**: Build systems that work across 19 countries with different languages, currencies, and regulations\n\n### **For this role you'll need:**\n\n* 8+ years software development experience with 3+ years in senior/lead roles\n* 5+ years' experience developing across the full stack including NodeJS / React / JavaScript / TypeScript\n\n* Proven experience with high-traffic web platforms and large-scale, high-availability systemsStrong background in AWS cloud platform and infrastructure as code (CloudFormation or serverless architecture)\n* Experience with microservices architecture and distributed systems using AWS Lambda\n* Deep understanding of monitoring, observability, and incident response for production systems\n* Strong understanding of automated pipelines, CI/CD, AWS CodePipeline\n* Knowledge of payment processing systems and PCI DSS compliance\n* Experience with DevOps practices and tooling\n* Strong understanding of CSS / frameworks like bootstrap / SASS / LESS\n* HTTP and REST or GraphQL\n* Strong understanding of testing frameworks\n* Experience working with agile development processes\n* Excellent communication skills and ability to translate business needs into technical language\n* Track record of leading teams through critical incidents and high-pressure situations\n\n### **Desirable:**\n\n* Advanced prompt engineering for code generation, RAG system design & AI system architecture\n* Experience with AI/ML implementation and architectural principles\n* Experience with AI-powered personalisation and content generation\n* Experience with headless CMS\n* Knowledge of front end framework alternatives to React (eg Angular, Vue)\n* Experience establishing and maintaining UI component libraries\n* Knowledge of CDN strategies for global reach\n* Experience with security architecture and threat modelling\n* Knowledge of zero-trust security principles\n* Health care domain experience (bonus points if you've saved lives with code before)\n* Experience working in newly established teams helping to build shared outcomes\n* Exposure to Quantum-resistant cryptography\n* Experience with technical ROI assessment\n* Experience working with off-shore development teams\n\n**GOOD CAUSE:**  \nWorking for **Movember**, you’ll help raise millions for men’s health (not for a CEO’s bonus). And all those dollars do a whole lotta good. We’ve funded cancer research. Created lifesaving medicines. And helped make cancer treatments less “one-size-fits-all”, and more specific to each patient’s needs.\n\nWe’re even calling for governments worldwide to get it together on men’s health. By meeting directly with policymakers so they change the systems that change men’s health.\n\n**GOOD VIBES:**  \nThe vibes aren’t just for Fridays – even though we start weekends early nine months of the year. Here, it always feels like something big’s about to happen. Be it an office-wide surprise birthday party (with cake!) or an impromptu all-staff boogie.\n\nCome the hairy season, the energy gets silly. We’re talking celebrity visits. Live stunts on-site for TV and radio. And when we hit a fundraising milestone, the office gong might even go off. And that means one thing: it’s conga time.\n\n**GOOD CREW:**  \nLet’s just get this out of the way: big egos need not apply. We’re all about straight-up solid human beings out to do meaningful work. People who’ll help you reach career-best moments. And give you the freedom to get there the best way you see fit.\n\nHybrid remote working is the norm. And in the office, you can sit where you please. Who knows? On any given day you could even end up desk buddies with the man who started this all.\n\n* Flexible hybrid working from home and our modern Richmond office\n* Finish work at 2pm on Fridays (Dec-Aug)\n* NFP salary packaging (pay less tax)\n* 13 weeks paid parental leave and 5 weeks annual leave\n* Fun & collaborative culture with employee social events\n* Free Headspace subscription and other wellbeing initiative\n* Relaxed dress code\n\n**Boy, do we know the feeling of being judged.** (Over how we look, and other things that shouldn’t matter.) Being different is how we started. And it’s also helped us raise $1 billion for men’s health. So, we know the power of diverse experiences, skills and perspectives.\n\nAnd another impressive number is our WGEA gender pay gap: it sits at a big, fat, round 0%. If you’ve got the relevant skills and the right attitude, let nothing stand in your way of firing off your application.\n\n**Do you want to DO GOOD?**  \nIf so, we’d love to hear from you.",

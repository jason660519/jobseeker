# Railway deployment configuration
# This file tells Railway which files to ignore during deployment

# Force Railway to use Procfile by temporarily ignoring complex configurations
# Comment/uncomment lines below to switch between deployment methods

# Option 1: Use Procfile (simple automatic detection)
nixpacks.toml
railway.toml

# Option 2: Use nixpacks (comment out the above lines)
# Leave nixpacks.toml and railway.toml active

# Always ignore Docker files to prevent Railway from using Docker
Dockerfile*
docker-compose.yml
docker-compose.yaml
.dockerignore

# Force nixpacks usage by ignoring Docker files
# Railway will then use nixpacks.toml as the next priority
# Note: Dockerfile.railway is kept as backup but ignored for now

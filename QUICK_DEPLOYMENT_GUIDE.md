## ‚úÖ Pre-deployment Checklist

Your project is already Railway-ready! These files are configured:

- ‚úÖ `web_app/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- ‚úÖ `web_app/Procfile` - Backup startup configuration
- ‚úÖ Flask app with production settings

## üéØ Deploy to Railway (5 minutes)

5. **Choose your JobSpy repository**
6. **Select `web_app` as root directory** (Railway will auto-detect)

## üåê Deploy Frontend to GitHub Pages (Optional)

If you want the frontend on GitHub Pages for free:

    // ... other config
};
```

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages

## üí∞ Cost Comparison

| Platform | Cost | Features |
|----------|------|----------|
| **Railway** | $5/month free tier | Full Flask app, database, auto-scaling |
| **GitHub Pages** | FREE | Static hosting only, requires external API |
| **Heroku** | $7/month | Similar to Railway, more complex setup |
| **Vercel** | FREE tier | Good for static sites, limited for Flask |

## üéØ My Recommendation

**For Jason Yu's JobSpy project:**

### **Best Option: Railway Only**
- **Cost**: $5/month (likely free for your usage)
- **Setup Time**: 5 minutes
- **Maintenance**: Zero
- **Professional URL**: ‚úÖ
- **HTTPS**: ‚úÖ
- **Scaling**: Automatic

**Why this works best:**
1. Your project is already configured for Railway
2. JobSpy is a dynamic application that needs backend processing
3. Railway handles all the server management
4. You get a professional domain immediately
5. Perfect for portfolio/demo purposes

### **Alternative: Hybrid (Railway + GitHub Pages)**
If you want to minimize costs:
- **Backend on Railway**: $5/month (or free tier)
- **Frontend on GitHub Pages**: FREE
- **Total**: Potentially FREE with Railway's generous free tier
